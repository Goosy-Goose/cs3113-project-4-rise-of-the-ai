For some reason, the animations only work half the time. If you don't a red dinosaur when you first start the program, or if you don't see three red dinosaurs total, or if the red dinosaurs are glitching and looking weird, then just comment out line 128 in Entity.cpp. Left and Right walking work but the other don't 50% of the time, and I don't know why.

Arrow keys to move
Space to jump
Jump on the red dinosaurs to kill them
